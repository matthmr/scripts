These are scripts for ACPI actions, of which we consider only these four:

1. shutdown
2. reboot
3. suspend (to RAM)
4. suspend (to disk, aka hibernate)

The intended usage of these scripts is to call the ACPI action with the script
name being the name of the action, plus the prefix `do-` (doshutdown, dosuspend,
etc). They create a new tmux session, with the action name as the session name.

From there, 1 and 2 will call the script with prefix `-lock`, and it will lock
the action to do house-cleaning. It will then call `lock.sh` and try to do the
actions set by `-lock`.

3 and 4 will call the script with prefix `-confirm` to confirm the action, with
no house-cleaning needed.
